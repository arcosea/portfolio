                <p>
                    Family & Friends and the time I spend with them is something I value dearly. I am the eldest of a total of four boys. I am the first in my family to have graduated
                    High school and attended University! My parents and I were born in Mexico. However, unlike them, I was brought to the United States at a young age
                    and did not have the pressure to work from an early age to help provide essentials. I had the opportunity and support to be able to attend higher education.

                <p>
                    Whether it was street soccer or club, I had always enjoyed playing Soccer. While I had played street soccer in the early stages of my life, I didn't play officially for a team
                    till 6th grade. Aside from Soccer, I also really enjoyed Running. I had run in Track for the first time in 8th grade where I ran a 5:24 mile. After a poor first and second year soccer experience 
                    in High School, I eventually decided to stop playing soccer & focus mainly on Track and Cross Country. I ended High School with a 4:45 mile and a 18:09 5Km personal Best.

                    I attended Pacific Lutheran University where I continued running Track and Cross Country. My Freshman year I only ran Track where I finished the season with
                    a 16:35 5Km back in 2019. While, my collegiate running career comes to an end this Spring of 2023, I have since then ran a 
                    15:43 5Km in Track and 26:17 8Km personal bests. I have also done an unofficial half marathon in 1:18:05.
