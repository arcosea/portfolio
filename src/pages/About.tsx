                    Hey Everyone! My Name is <strong>Erick Arcos</strong>, a student-athlete at <em>Pacific Lutheran University</em>. 
                    I am studying <strong>Applied Physics (BS)</strong> and <strong>Computer Science (BA)</strong> with a Minor in Mathematics. 
                    I will be graduating in <strong> May of 2023. </strong> Some of my career interests include: Robotics, Space exploration, Astronomy, 
                    Aerospace Engineering, Embedded Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Software Development and so much more! 
                    All of these are subjects fascinating and I am someone that can adapt well to new learning environments.

                    <p>
                        Family & Friends and the time I spend with them is something I value dearly. I am the eldest of a total of four boys. I am the first in my family to have graduated
                        High school and attended University! My parents and I were born in Mexico. However, unlike them, I was brought to the United States at a young age
                        and did not have the pressure to work from an early age to help provide essentials. I had the opportunity and support to be able to attend higher education.

                    <span className="sub-title"> 
                        Soccer
                    </span>
                    <p>
                        Whether it was street soccer or club, I had always enjoyed playing Soccer. While I had played street soccer in the early stages of my life, I didn't play officially for a team
                        till 6th grade. After a poor first and second year soccer experience in High School, I eventually decided to stop playing soccer & focus mainly on Track and Cross Country.
                    </p>
                    <span className="sub-title"> 
                        Track
                    </span>
                    <p>
                        Aside from Soccer, I also really enjoyed Running. I ran track for first time in 8th grade where I ran a 5:24 mile. I continued doing track in High School starting my junior year, 
                        I ended High School with a 4:45 1600 meter . I continued running Track at Pacific Lutheran University where I ran 16:35 in the 5 Km (over 90 seconds faster than in High School) my freshman year.
                        I have since then ran a 15:43 5Km and 4:16 1500meters.
                    </p>
                    <span className="sub-title"> 
                        Cross Country
                    </span>
                    <p>
                        After doing Track in High School, I was persuaded to do Cross Country and loved it a lot more than Track. I finished High school with a not so well time of 18:09 5 Km.
                        I attended Pacific Lutheran University where I continued running Track and Cross Country. Although I did not compete for Cross Country my freshman year, and lost a year due 
                        the 2020 pandemic, I have run a best of 26:17 8km. I have also done an unofficial half marathon in 1:18:05.

                        Aside from running and soccer, other activies I really enjoy include volleyball, badminton and hiking. I have also recently gotten into Rock Climbing & will
                        try to incorporate it more in the future.
